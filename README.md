# Attendance Management App Using Facial Recognition

## Project Overview
The **Attendance Management App** is designed to automate the attendance tracking process in educational institutions using facial recognition technology. It aims to provide an efficient, accurate, and user-friendly solution for both students and faculty. The app captures and verifies students' facial features to mark attendance, reducing errors and fraud associated with traditional attendance methods.

## Features
- **Student Login & Registration**: Allows students to create an account, log in, and register their face for recognition.
- **Faculty Dashboard**: Faculty members can manage courses, track attendance, and view detailed attendance records.
- **Facial Recognition**: Uses facial recognition technology to identify students and mark their attendance automatically.
- **Course Management**: Faculty can add and manage courses, while students can view and register for their classes.
- **Attendance Records**: Both students and faculty can view attendance data and track trends over time.
